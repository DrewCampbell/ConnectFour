Connect Four simulator
This will run a simulation of a connect four game. The attempt is for the computer to learn from past experience which moves lead to a win, and to avoid those moves that lead to a loss. Initial commit just runs a simulation game with random moves until a winner is found. Displays these results in a non-graphic 2x2 grid with player moves represented by either 1 or 2, and empty spaces = 0.
